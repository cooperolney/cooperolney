I'm a Data Science major with a Math minor at St. Lawrence University, passionate about using data-driven insights to solve real-world problems. My experiences have deepened my interest in sustainability and energy systems, where I enjoy exploring how data can support smarter and more efficient resource use. I’m equally passionate about sports analytics, using statistical modeling and machine learning to uncover insights in player and team performance.

Recently, I've worked on projects that bridge data science and education by developing interactive, sports-themed teaching modules in R for undergraduate statistics and data science courses through the SCORE Network. I also have experience in developing web applications and interactive dashboards, handling both the user-facing design and data-driven functionality that make data more accessible and engaging.

I'm especially interested in industries related to sports analytics and sustainability, where I can combine data, technology, and creative problem-solving. I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply my data science skills to impactful, real-world projects.
